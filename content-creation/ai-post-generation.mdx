# Generate AI Posts

After importing your content into BeeHype, you can easily transform it into engaging social media posts using our AI assistant. Here's how it works:

## Quick Demo

Watch how easy it is to generate posts for multiple platforms:

<div className="relative w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto my-8">
  <video 
    controls
    preload="metadata"
    className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  >
    <source src="https://cdn.beehype.io/generate-ai-posts.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

## Step 1: Choose Your Platforms

Select the social media platforms where you want to share your content:
- LinkedIn
- X (Twitter)

You can select multiple platforms at once and our AI will optimize content for each one.

## Step 3: Additional Options

### Call-to-Action (CTA)
