## Data Security & Privacy

Your API credentials are our top priority when it comes to security:

- **Encrypted Storage**: All API keys are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption
- **Limited Usage**: Keys are only accessed when performing specific actions like importing content or syncing data
- **No Unnecessary Access**: We never use your keys for any purpose other than the features you've explicitly enabled
- **Complete Deletion**: When you disconnect an integration, all associated API keys are immediately and permanently deleted from our servers
- **Secure Transmission**: All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Regular Security Audits**: Our systems undergo regular security assessments to ensure your data remains protected
