Connect your Substack newsletter to automatically transform your content into engaging social media posts.

## Prerequisites

- A Substack publication
- Your Substack domain (e.g., `mynewsletter.substack.com`)

## Connecting Your Newsletter

Unlike Beehiiv and ConvertKit, Substack doesn't currently provide an API or OAuth2 integration. Instead, BeeHype uses a simplified connection process:

1. Go to [BeeHype Integrations](https://www.beehype.io/app/integrations)
2. In the Substack section, click "Connect"
3. Enter your Substack domain (e.g., `mynewsletter.substack.com`)
4. Click "Save Configuration"

</Frame>

<Warning>
Make sure to enter your domain exactly as it appears in your browser's address bar, without `http://` or `www.`
</Warning>

## Content Access

Due to Substack's platform limitations, BeeHype can access:

✅ **Public Posts**
- Full content
- Images and media
- Publication date
- Title and description

⚠️ **Subscriber-Only Posts**
- Preview content only
- Title and description
- Publication date
- Featured image (if public)

<Note>
We respect Substack's content access restrictions. For subscriber-only posts, we can only transform the publicly available preview content into social media posts. However, you can still use the full content of your private posts by copying and pasting them directly into BeeHype's content editor.
</Note>

## Verification & Next Steps

After connecting:

1. The status will show as "Connected"
2. Go to [Create Content](https://www.beehype.io/app/create) to import your Substack posts
3. Select the posts you want to transform into social media content

<Note>
You can import your posts at any time from the Create Content page. This gives you full control over which posts you want to transform into social media content.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify your Substack domain is entered correctly
2. Ensure your publication is active and accessible
3. Check if your posts are publicly visible
4. Wait a few minutes for content synchronization
