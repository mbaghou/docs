## Data Security & Privacy

Your API credentials are our top priority when it comes to security:

- **Encrypted Storage**: All API keys are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption
- **Limited Usage**: Keys are only accessed when performing specific actions like importing content or syncing data
- **No Unnecessary Access**: We never use your keys for any purpose other than the features you've explicitly enabled
- **Complete Deletion**: When you disconnect an integration, all associated API keys are immediately and permanently deleted from our servers
- **Secure Transmission**: All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Regular Security Audits**: Our systems undergo regular security assessments to ensure your data remains protected

<Info>
BeeHype is committed to maintaining the highest security standards. Your trust is essential to us, and we've built our infrastructure with privacy and security as core principles.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

2. Ensure your API key has not been revoked
3. Check if your Beehiiv subscription is active
4. Confirm you have admin access to the publication
